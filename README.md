# G-W
Game and Watch collection and repair guide website, should be build to be open to other like discogs eventually

## First step = personal collection

* a json file with information regarding the main part of my personal collection with proper images of my game and watchs in png have been created
* json file contains both general information about each games (to be added for the whole list) and specific details such as condition(scratches, serial number, battery cover), repairs made etc
* the collection page will be responsive to a certain point with two views, either the GW image in large or a list with details and a small image
* the option to sort the game and watches depending of the release date only select a type of GW personal rating will be added (the options should be considered)
* clicking on the concerned GW should redirect to a page with only the concerned GW and all details from JSON
